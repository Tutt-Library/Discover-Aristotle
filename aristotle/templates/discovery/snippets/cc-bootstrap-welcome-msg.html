<h1>Welcome to Tutt Library's TIGER Catalog</h1>
<p>
 The new TIGER catalog, also called a Discovery Layer, includes a number of
 new features like:
</p>
 <ul>
  <li style="font-size: 1em;">Faceted search options to narrow search results</li>
  <li style="font-size: 1em;">Saving items to a cart that can then be emailed, printed, or exported
      to RefWorks</li>
  <li style="font-size: 1em;">Search History</li>
 </ul>
<p>
 In addition, we are releasing the first library apps for smartphones and
 tablets. These library apps also support most modern web browsers on
 personal computers. To access the Tutt Library's growing number of apps,

 The new TIGER is an open-source project and you can contribute to its design 
 and functionality. The source code repository is available on
