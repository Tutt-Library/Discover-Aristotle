What is the New TIGER?
-----------------------

The new TIGER is our updated library catalog.  It includes various new features, such as

- faceted search options to narrow your search results, by availability, by call number, etc.,
- a saved resources folder to save records of specific items for your future reference, with the ability to export to Refworks,
- and Search History if you wish to return to a previous search.

Additionally, TIGER now hosts a portfolio of new discovery and access apps.
